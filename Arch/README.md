# Arch
A personal log of my adventures in Arch. It's nice to have a record for posterity!

### Configuration
In order of their happening.
1. [Installation](/Arch/tutorials/initial_setup.md)
1. [Post-Installation](/Arch/tutorials/post_install.md)
1. [Xorg Installation](/Arch/tutorials/xorg_installation.md)

### Diamonds in the Rough
Hopefully a list of reasons to keep using Arch, or linux in general.
- [Reading EDIDs](/Arch/tutorials/edid.md)
- Launch a minimal GUI with [Xorg and TWM](/Arch/tutorials/xorg_twm.md)!

## Diary?
**07/14/19**  
I had a relevant epiphany this morning: when I was first becoming proficient with a computer circa Windows 2000 (_shhh, I'm telling a story_), I had vague dreams of one day figuring out how to program my own app launcher and making my system look and act exactly the way I wanted. _"Maybe,"_ I thought, _"I could even build my own operating system from the ground up!...how silly of me!"_  
As I stare at a blank, vanilla Xorg session---thinking about all the possibilities of where this project might go---I realize how close this feels to achieving something of those lofty dreams, after years of "lesser" attempts via minor system customizations.  
It's a neat feeling. :) Thanks, Arch!
